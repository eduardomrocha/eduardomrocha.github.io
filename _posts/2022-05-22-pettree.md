lead_text: "Pet Tree is an App created by a group of friends just for fun. We came up with the idea for this project in order to learn new technologies, tools, and abilities. <br><br>The concept was to build a social network where users could use a mobile app to record trees they had planted. In the same app, the user may see the trees of other users on a map. The registered trees would be made accessible to users only after being reviewed and authorized by an administrator. These reviews would be carried out by administrators using a web application. <br><br>Elixir with the Phoenix framework was chosen for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, ReactJS for the web application, and React Native for the mobile application. <br><br>Initially, I was just responsible for the backend development, where I designed and implemented the API. After that, I started working on the web application with ReactJS, and after finishing that, I also contributed with the mobile app development."
